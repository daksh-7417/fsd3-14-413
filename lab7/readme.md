## components
1. simple js functions return html directory
2. it must starts with capital letter
3. it should be treated as html tag
4. it must be closed
## Object destructure
const {bname,price,quantity,rating,picurl} = props.book;
- does not depends on order, if property is not available then it intialize with null

const {price,picurl} = props.book;
- it only takes price and picurl from the book 

const{price,...rest} = props.book;

## any components include styles
1. external css - create class in index.css and use in component
2. internal css - create property as object like
```
const qtyStyle = {
    fontSize:"1rem",
    color:"blue",
    textAlign:"center",
    backgroundColor:"Yellow",
    padding:"10px"
  }
  ```
  then apply with style attribute and pass the object
  
3. inline - in this method we use 2 curly bracket with style attribute. All the CSS property must be sinlge word. for ex: text-align becomes textAlign(camel case)

rafce - arrow
rfce - function
